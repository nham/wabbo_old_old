# Background facts

Here are some facts about matrices that I'm not going to bother to prove (and, in some cases, haven't actually bothered to prove myself, because ugh, really?)

For matrices with entries in some field $\mathbb{F}$:

Addition:

 - is associative
 - is commutative
 - has an additive identity
 - has additive inverses

The above all follow from addition among field elements, since matrix addition is defined component-wise.

Matrix multiplication:

 - is associative
 - has a multiplicative identity
 - distributes over addition.

Interesting, this means that $n \times n$ matrices form a ring. I've never heard of a ring of square matrices, though that's apparently just a symptom of my ignorance, as there is a [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_ring) on it.

This ring is not commutative, and there are zero-divisors so that the set of all $n \times n$ matrices is not a domain.
