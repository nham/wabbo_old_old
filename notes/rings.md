# Notes on ring theory

An **associative ring** is a triple $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $(R, +)$ is an abelian group and $\cdot$ is an associative binary operation on $R$ such that $\forall r, s, t \in R$:

 - $r \cdot (s + t) = r \cdot s + r \cdot t$
 - $(r + s) \cdot t = r \cdot t + s \cdot t$

The operation $\cdot$ is often called *multiplication* (as the notation suggests).

A **unital ring** or **ring with unit/identity** is an associative ring which has a multiplicative identity, i.e. there's some element $1 \in R$ such that $r \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot r = r$ for all $r \in R$.

A **commutative ring** is a ring where multiplication is commutative.
