# Group theory notes

## Prerequisites
Basic set theory (sets, unions, intersections, cartesian products, relations, functions). In particular, binary operations (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation>) and restrictions of a function (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_(mathematics)>). Also, equivalence relations, in particular that each equivalence relation yields a partition and vice versa.

## Fundamentals

A **group** is a set $G$ with a binary operation on $G$ which is 1) associative, 2) has a unit, and 3) has inverses under the operation for each $g \in G$.

That means that 1) $\forall a,b,c \in G$ $a \circ (b \circ c) = (a \circ b) \circ c$, 2) there is an element $u \in G$ such that for every $g \in G$ u \circ g = g \circ u = g$, and 3) for every $g \in G$ there exists an $h \in G$ such that $g \circ h = h \circ g = v$, where $v$ is one of the units that (2) stipulates must exist.

**Unit is unique:** If there are two such elements $u$ and $e$, such that for any $g \in G$, $ug = gu = g$ and $eg = ge = g$, then $u = ue = e$.

By convention we notate the unique unit of group $G$ as $e$, or $e_G$ if we need to distinguish between the units of two groups.

**The cancellation law** For all $a,b,c \in G$, $ab = ac$ means that, since there's a $d \in G$ such that $da = ad = e$, we must have $d(ab) = d(ac)$, so by associativity $b = c$. The same strategy suffices to show that $if ba = ca$, then $b = c$. The former property could be called *left cancellation* and the latter *right cancellation*. Groups have *both* properties.

**Inverses are unique:** If $d$ and $f$ are both inverses for $a$, then $d = de = d(af) = (da)f = ef = f$.

Since inverses are unique, we can define a function $\cdot^{-1}$ which takes each elemeent of the group to its inverse. Hence we will often denote the inverse of $g \in G$ by $g^{-1}$.

**Unique solvability of equations:** For fixed $a, b \in G$, the equations $xa = b$ and $ay = b$ have unique solutions. Clearly $x = b a^{-1]$ is one possible solution. If $za = b$, then $za = xa$, and by cancellation $x = z$. So $x = b a^{-1}$ is the unique solution. The same argument shows that $y = a^{-1} b$ is the unique solution of the second equation.

**Inverses of inverses:** $\forall g \in G$, $(g^{-1})^{-1}$ is the unique solution to $xg^{-1} = e$. But $g$ solves that as well, so they must be the same.

**Inverse of product is product of inverses:** Similarly to the previous proof, $b^{-1} a^{-1}$ solves $x(ab) = e$.

**Parens can be dropped in group products:** [See here for now](http://www.wabbo.org/blov/20130506-associative_operators_on_n_args.html)

A group whose operation is commutative is called a **commutative** (naturally enough) or an **abelian**  group.

The **order** of a group $G$ is the cardinality of the underlying set of the group. We notate this $|G|$ (which is not a special notation, it is just the standard notation for the cardinality of a set). For *finite* groups, the order is just the number of group elements. There are infinite groups as well (e.g. the integers over addition).

**Power notation:** For any group $G$, with $g \in G$, we define $g^0 = e$, $g^1 = g$, $g^2 = gg$, and $g^n = g g^{n-1}$ for any $n \in \mathbb{P}$. We can also define $g^{-2} = g^{-1} g^{-1}$ and $g^{-n} = g^{-1} g^{-n + 1}$.

## Subgroups

A subset $H$ of (the underlying set of) a group $G$ is called a **subgroup* precisely when the group operation being restricted to $H$ makes $H$ into a group.

**Alternate characterization of subgroups:** A subset $S$ of $G$ is a subgroup iff it is closed under products of $G$ and contains all its inverses (in $G$).

*Proof:* Obviously a subgroup (being a group) is closed under products and contains its inverses. Conversely, since $\forall a,b \in S$, $ab \in S$, the restriction of the $G$ operation to $S$ is closed over $S$, so the restriction is well-defined. It's also associative since it's associative for all elements in $G$. Since all $a \in S$ have $a^{-1} \in S$ as well, then $a a^{-1} = e \in S$, so $S$ contains the unit of $G$ (which is obviously a unit for $S$). This means the restriction of the group operation to $S$ turns $S$ into a group, so it is a subgroup. $\Box$

**Intersection of subgroups is a subgroup:** If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are subgroups of $G$, then $H_1 \cap H_2$ is too. More generally. an arbitrary collection $\mathcal{H}$ of subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup.

*Proof:* If $a, b \in \bigcap \mathcal{H}$, then $a$ and $b$ are elements of each subgroup in $\mathcal{H}$, so $ab$ is an element of each as well. Hence $ab \in \bigcap \mathcal{H}$. Similarly, $a^{-1} \in \bigcap \mathcal{H}$. $\Box$

**Subgroup generated by a subset:** If $S \subseteq G$, it  may not necessarily form a subgroup (if, for example, the product of two elements in $S$ is not in $S$, or if an inverse is missing). We can create a subgroup that contains $S$ by adding precisely the elements that are missing, and we call this the *subgroup generated by $S$*. It is defined by

$$\langle S \rangle := \{s_1^{k_1} \cdots s_n^{k_n} : s_i \in S, k_i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

In other words, its the set of all possible products of integer powers of elements of $S$. 

We can see that this must be a subgroup, because the product of two products of integer powers of elements of $S$ is again a product of integer powers of elements of $S$. Also, to obtain the inverse for a product of integer powers, reverse the order of elements and negate the power. This inverse is clearly in $\langle S \rangle$.

We look next at a particularly important special case.

The **cyclic subgroup generated by $g$** is the subgroup generated by the singleton set $\{g\}$ for $g \in G$. It is the set $\langle g \rangle = \{ g^k : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$

More generally, we say a group $G$ is **cyclic** if it is *generated* by a single element, meaning that there is some $c \in G$ such that for every $g \in G$, $g = c^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. In words: every element of $G$ can be represented as a power of some fixed element.

The **order** of an element $g \in G$ is defined to be the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$.

I'm not sure this next one is important, but I've included it because I think it's neat.

**Sufficient condition for subgroup of a finite group:** If a subset $S$ of a finite $G$ is closed over the group product, then it forms a subgroup.

*Proof:* TODO

If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then we can define a relation on $G$ called **congruence modulo $H$** by

$$a \equiv b \text{mod} H$ if $\exists h \in H a = hb$.

Equivalently $a \equiv b \text{mod} H$ iff $ab^{-1} \in H$

**Congruence modulo a subgroup is an equivalence relation:** Clearly $a \equiv a \text{mod} H$, since $e \in H$. If $\exists h$ such that $a = hb$, then $h^{-1} a = b$, so that the relation is symmetric. Finally, if $a = hb$, $b = gc$, then $a = (hg)c$. Because $H$ is a subgroup, this means that $a \equiv c \text{mod} H$. $\Box$

A **(right) coset** of a subgroup $H$ in $G$ is the subset of $G$ defined by

$$\{ha : h \in H\}$$

for some $a \in G$. The following is nearly immediate:

**The right cosets of $H$ are the equivalence classes of congruence modulo $H$**.

This means that the right cosets of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$. We have nearly proved a very important fact about groups, and will lock in the missing piece now:

**Cosets are the same size:** We prove there is a bijection between any right coset $Hg$ and $H$. Think about how we generate the elements of $Hg$. We could not have $h_1 g = h_2 g$ for distinct $h_1$ and $h_2$ due to cancellation. Hence the function $H \rightarrow Hg$ defined by $h \mapsto hg$ is well-defined and an injection. It's also a surjection due to $Hg$ basically being defined as the image of this function.

Since every right coset of $H$ is bijective to $H$, any two right cosets are in bijection (the composition of bijections is a bijection). $\Box$

**Lagrange's theorem:** If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$. This is because the right cosets of $H$ partition $G$ into $|H|$-sized blocks, as proven above. $\Box$

The **index** of a subgroup $H$ of $G$, denoted $[G : H]$, is the number of right cosets it generates.

- groups of prime order are cyclic

## Homomorphisms and normal subgroups

A **group homomorphism** from group $G$ to group $K$ is a function $\phi: G \rightarrow K$ such that $\phi(gh) = \phi(g) \phi(h)$ for all $g, h \in G$.

- kernel of a homomorphism

- left cosets of a subgroup

- conjugation of a subgroup

- Normal subgroup

Definitely use Gowers' approach to normal subgroups. I actively dislike the "coset algebra" approach that isn't even strictly an algebra between cosets since you need to do manipulations like (Na)(Nb) = N(aN)b. So you need to take (aN)b, which is...something. And then take left multiplication of that result by N. Ugly. (Though to be fair, something like this is suggested by conjugation. But I think its cleaner to restrict it to actual conjugation)
