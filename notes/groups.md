# Group theory notes

A **group** is a set $G$ with a binary operation on $G$ which is 1) associative, 2) has a unit, and 3) has inverses under the operation for each $g \in G$.

A group whose operation is commutative is called a **commutative** (naturally enough) or an **abelian**  group.

- all groupings of a product of n elements are the same

**Unit is unique:** If there are two such elements $u$ and $e$, such that for any $g \in G$, $ug = gu = g$ and $eg = ge = g$, then $u = ue = e$.

By convention we notate the unique unit of group $G$ as $e$, or $e_G$ if we need to distinguish between the units of two groups.

**The cancellation law** For all $a,b,c \in G$, $ab = ac$ means that, since there's a $d \in G$ such that $da = ad = e$, we must have $d(ab) = d(ac)$, so by associativity $b = c$. The same strategy suffices to show that $if ba = ca$, then $b = c$. The former property could be called *left cancellation* and the latter *right cancellation*. Groups have *both* properties.

**Inverses are unique:** If $d$ and $f$ are both inverses for $a$, then $d = de = d(af) = (da)f = ef = f$.

- unique solvability of equations

- order of a group

- subgroup, two definitions

- sufficient condition for subgroups of a finite group

- intersection of subgroups is a subgroup

- subgroup generated by a subset

- cyclic subgroup generated by an element

- cyclic groups

- congruence modulo a subgroup (equivalence relation)

- (right) cosets of a subgroup

- Lagrange's theorem

- groups of prime order are cyclic

- index of a subgroup

- order of an element

- homomorphisms

- kernel of a homomorphism

- left cosets of a subgroup

- conjugation of a subgroup

- Normal subgroup

Definitely use Gowers' approach to normal subgroups. I actively dislike the "coset algebra" approach that isn't even strictly an algebra between cosets since you need to do manipulations like (Na)(Nb) = N(aN)b. So you need to take (aN)b, which is...something. And then take left multiplication of that result by N. Ugly. (Though to be fair, something like this is suggested by conjugation. But I think its cleaner to restrict it to actual conjugation)
