# Group theory notes

## Fundamentals

A **group** is a set $G$ with a binary operation on $G$ which is 1) associative, 2) has a unit, and 3) has inverses under the operation for each $g \in G$.

**Unit is unique:** If there are two such elements $u$ and $e$, such that for any $g \in G$, $ug = gu = g$ and $eg = ge = g$, then $u = ue = e$.

By convention we notate the unique unit of group $G$ as $e$, or $e_G$ if we need to distinguish between the units of two groups.

**The cancellation law** For all $a,b,c \in G$, $ab = ac$ means that, since there's a $d \in G$ such that $da = ad = e$, we must have $d(ab) = d(ac)$, so by associativity $b = c$. The same strategy suffices to show that $if ba = ca$, then $b = c$. The former property could be called *left cancellation* and the latter *right cancellation*. Groups have *both* properties.

**Inverses are unique:** If $d$ and $f$ are both inverses for $a$, then $d = de = d(af) = (da)f = ef = f$.

Since inverses are unique, we can define a function $\cdot^{-1}$ which takes each elemeent of the group to its inverse. Hence we will often denote the inverse of $g \in G$ by $g^{-1}$.

**Unique solvability of equations:** For fixed $a, b \in G$, the equations $xa = b$ and $ay = b$ have unique solutions. Clearly $x = b a^{-1]$ is one possible solution. If $za = b$, then $za = xa$, and by cancellation $x = z$. So $x = b a^{-1}$ is the unique solution. The same argument shows that $y = a^{-1} b$ is the unique solution of the second equation.

**Parens can be dropped in group products:** [See here for now](http://www.wabbo.org/blov/20130506-associative_operators_on_n_args.html)

A group whose operation is commutative is called a **commutative** (naturally enough) or an **abelian**  group.

- order of a group

- subgroup, two definitions

- sufficient condition for subgroups of a finite group

- intersection of subgroups is a subgroup

- subgroup generated by a subset

- cyclic subgroup generated by an element

- cyclic groups

- congruence modulo a subgroup (equivalence relation)

- (right) cosets of a subgroup

- Lagrange's theorem

- groups of prime order are cyclic

- index of a subgroup

- order of an element

- homomorphisms

- kernel of a homomorphism

- left cosets of a subgroup

- conjugation of a subgroup

- Normal subgroup

Definitely use Gowers' approach to normal subgroups. I actively dislike the "coset algebra" approach that isn't even strictly an algebra between cosets since you need to do manipulations like (Na)(Nb) = N(aN)b. So you need to take (aN)b, which is...something. And then take left multiplication of that result by N. Ugly. (Though to be fair, something like this is suggested by conjugation. But I think its cleaner to restrict it to actual conjugation)
