# Group theory notes

- definition

- abelian group

- all groupings of a product of n elements are the same

- unique identity

- cancellation law

- unique inverse

- unique solvability of equations

- order of a group

- homomorphisms

- subgroup, two definitions

- sufficient condition for subgroups of a finite group

- intersection of subgroups is a subgroup

- subgroup generated by a subset

- cyclic subgroup generated by an element

- cyclic groups

- congruence modulo a subgroup (equivalence relation)

- (right) cosets of a subgroup

- Lagrange's theorem

- groups of prime order are cyclic

- index of a subgroup

- order of an element

- kernel of a homomorphism

- left cosets of a subgroup

- conjugation of a subgroup

- Normal subgroup

Definitely use Gowers' approach to normal subgroups. I actively dislike the "coset algebra" approach that isn't even strictly an algebra between cosets since you need to do manipulations like (Na)(Nb) = N(aN)b. So you need to take (aN)b, which is...something. And then take left multiplication of that result by N. Ugly. (Though to be fair, something like this is suggested by conjugation. But I think its cleaner to restrict it to actual conjugation)
