Today at work I conceived a study project for this summer, of which this log entry is the initial manifestation. It is code-named "GOLALP", for Go, Linear Algebra, and Linear Programming. Here's a syllabus:

*Linear Geometry*, Gruenberg and Weir
*Linear Algebra*, Hoffman and Kunze
*Understanding and Using Linear Programming*, Matousek and Gartner
*Introduction to Linear Optimization*, Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis
Whatever Go resources I can cobble together online. The Go specification, Effective Go, et al.
*Elementary Euclidean Geometry*, Gibson
Project Euler problems

The motivation seems simple to me: I need to learn linear algebra For Reals, and applications seems to be an essential complement to the theory for me. Linear programming and the EEG book are that complement. I'm also trying to learn Go, since I feel some need to get good with a language that isn't Python. Iono.

I read a bit of UULP, but I got annoyed when I got to chapter 4, Theory of Linear Programming, when it mentioned offhand that the set of solutions to a linear system is an affine subspace. It seems true, but Hoffman and Kunze doesn't even mention affine spaces in their entire book. This led me to searching out another source, which I seem to have found in *Linear Geometry*.
